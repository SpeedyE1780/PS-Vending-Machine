  <Description>
    THIS WORLD COMES FOR YOU
    Ride into a desperate dog-eat-dog world ravaged by a deadly pandemic as drifter and bounty hunter, Deacon St. John.

    Risk the threats of the broken road on the back of your trusty drifter bike as you face swarms of mindless feral Freakers – and equally terrifying humans.

    Unpredictable weather and different times of day and night can cause incredible danger and shocking surprises… and everything wants you dead.

    • Harsh open world: explore incredibly realistic vast and hostile regions of the Pacific Northwest.
    • Brutal sandbox combat: devise your strategies as you customise weapons and skills, craft traps and upgrade your bike.
    • Compelling story: survive an unforgiving wilderness as you search for a reason to live after suffering a deep, personal loss.
